I was able to successfully make a standalone application for a max patch. 
In max, there are tutorials for building "collectives" and "standalones".

*From the tutorials: "While collectives include the necessary resources to be opened in Max, they still require Max to operate. A standalone application is a collective that is combined with a copy of Max. Standalone applications, which are always platform-specific, can eliminate all external dependencies for others to run your patch."

*Building a standalone is what we need to do.
From the tutorials: "A collective file is built as part of the standalone process. The exact details of this process and the format of standalone applications differs between the Mac and Windows platforms. Note that even though your original patcher file might be platform-independent, standalone applications created with Max are definitely platform-specific." 


So we would need to make a mac and windows version. For my mac application, I just went File->Build Collective/Application-> added any additional directories to files that were critical to my app and then -> Build app. Should not be a problem for us at all.
