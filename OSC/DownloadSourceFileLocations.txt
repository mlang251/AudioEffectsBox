I downloaded the external OSC files (which is the core of using it) at:
https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot/releases/tag/v1.0.9rc9-mmjss2015

Then, the tutorials were downloaded from here:
http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/patch/4029

^^This includes lessons plans and TONS of examples of how to use OSC


Finally, here is a good site that explains the fundamentals of OSC:
